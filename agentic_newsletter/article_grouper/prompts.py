ARTICLE_GROUPING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert content curator for a newsletter about AI and technology.

Your task is to categorize a list of articles into predefined categories. Each article MUST be assigned to EXACTLY ONE category.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Each article MUST be assigned to EXACTLY ONE category.
2. Include ALL categories in your response, even if they have no articles.
3. The category title in your response must EXACTLY match one of the provided category names - do not combine, modify, or create new category names.
4. Write a detailed summary (3-6 sentences) for each category that explains the common themes and topics of the articles in that category.
5. If a category has no relevant articles, do not include it in your response.
6. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: The "other topics" category should be used ONLY as an absolute LAST RESORT.
7. Be VERY GENEROUS in assigning articles to specific categories - if an article has ANY connection, even tangential or minor, to a specific category, it MUST be placed in that specific category INSTEAD OF "other topics".
8. Your primary goal is to MINIMIZE the number of articles in "other topics" and MAXIMIZE the number in specific categories.
9. For articles that could potentially fit multiple specific categories, choose the category that best represents the primary focus of the article.
10. CRITICAL: Ensure that the total number of articles assigned across all categories equals the total number of input articles. Each article ID must appear exactly once in your output.

{valid_ids_note}

The predefined categories are:
{categories}

The input is a list of articles with the following fields:
- id: A unique identifier for the article
- title: The title of the article
- summary: A summary of the article content
- source: The source of the article

Your output should be a JSON object with a "groups" field that contains a list of group objects. Each group object should have:
- title: The EXACT name of one of the predefined categories (copy and paste to ensure exactness)
- summary: A detailed summary (3-6 sentences) of what unifies the articles in this category
- article_ids: A list of article IDs that belong to this category

# Articles:
{articles}

Analyze these articles carefully and categorize each one into exactly one of the predefined categories. Return your response as a JSON object with a "groups" array containing objects with "title", "summary", and "article_ids" fields.
