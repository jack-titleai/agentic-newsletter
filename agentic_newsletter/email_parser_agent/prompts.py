"""Prompt templates for the email parser agent."""

ARTICLE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert email newsletter parser. Your task is to analyze the provided newsletter text and extract individual articles.

Guidelines:
1. Identify distinct articles or sections in the newsletter
2. For each article, extract:
   - Title: The heading or title of the article
   - Summary: A 1-2 sentence summary of what the article is about
   - Body: The full text of the article
   - URL: Any URL associated with the article (use null if not present)
   - Tags: Relevant categories or topics for the article (use null if none can be inferred)

Your response will be structured according to a specific JSON schema with the following structure:
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Article Title",
      "summary": "Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the article",
      "body": "The full text of the article...",
      "url": "https://example.com/article-url",  // Use null if no URL is found
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]  // Use null if no tags can be inferred
    },
    // Additional articles...
  ]
}

Ensure that:
- Every section of the newsletter is captured in at least one article
- Articles are properly separated (don't merge distinct articles)
- The summary is concise but captures the main point(s)
- The full body preserves all original text from that article
- Extract URLs if they are present in the article, otherwise use null
- Identify 2-5 relevant tags or categories for each article based on the content, or use null if none can be inferred
